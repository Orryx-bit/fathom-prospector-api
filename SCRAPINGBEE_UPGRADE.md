## What to Expect in Next Search

### Before (Playwright - Failing):
```csv
First Name: [BLANK]

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/fathom-api-github
   git add .
   git commit -m "Replace Playwright with ScrapingBee for reliable scraping"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Railway will auto-deploy** (5-7 minutes)

3. **Verify in logs:**

## Cost Comparison

### Playwright (Free but Unreliable):
- ‚ùå Frequent failures in cloud
- ‚ùå High server costs (memory/CPU)
- ‚ùå Manual maintenance required

### ScrapingBee (Paid but Reliable):
- ‚úÖ 1,000 free API calls/month
- ‚úÖ $0.0005 per request after
- ‚úÖ ~$10-20/month for typical use
- ‚úÖ No infrastructure costs

**For your Venus trial (12-20 reps):**
- Estimated 200 searches/day √ó 30 days = 6,000 searches
- Cost: ~$3/month (well within free tier)
