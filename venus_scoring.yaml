# VENUS CONCEPTS - MANUFACTURER SCORING SYSTEM v4.1
# ============================================================================
# Philosophy: "Best Device Match" + "Enhanced Business Type Intelligence"
# - Each device scores independently (0-100 points)
# - Highest-scoring device = Manufacturer Opportunity Score
# - Business type detection with cash-pay infrastructure prioritization
# - ENHANCED PRAM Framework: Up to 60 points (was 40 in v4.0)
# - Expanded GLP-1 detection and weight-loss keyword engine
# - Financial readiness indicators and competitive gap analysis
# - Show only WINNING device breakdown for actionable intelligence

# SCORING METHODOLOGY
# ============================================================================

scoring_approach:
  method: "Device-Specific Custom Scoring + Enhanced Business Type Intelligence"
  max_points_per_device: 100
  manufacturer_score_calculation: "MAX(all device scores)"
  breakdown_display: "winning_device_only"
  fairness_principle: "All devices equal max points - no category bias"
  business_type_priority: "Cash-pay infrastructure > patient volume"
  pram_enhancement: "Increased from 40 to 60 max points for better scoring accuracy"
  
implementation_notes:
  - "Backend scores each device independently"
  - "Viva (facial) can score 100, Bliss MAX (body) can score 100"
  - "Nova gets GLP-1 bonus, Viva gets dermatology bonus, etc."
  - "Business type detection applies multipliers and boosts"
  - "Wellness center (200 patients) > Traditional OB/GYN (1,000 patients)"
  - "ENHANCED PRAM Framework quantifies cash-pay fluency (up to 60 points)"
  - "Expanded GLP-1/weight-loss detection with 20+ new keywords"
  - "Financial readiness indicators (pricing pages, financing logos, memberships)"
  - "Competitive device saturation detection reduces scores for over-equipped practices"
  - "Only show winning device's specific breakdown to rep"

    - "No penalty for specialization (body-only or face-only OK)"
    - "Each device scores independently 0-100"
    - "Highest score = Manufacturer Opportunity Score"
    - "Business type detection FIRST, then apply boosts and multipliers"
    - "ENHANCED PRAM Framework (60 points) adds significant scoring weight"
    - "GLP-1 detection expanded with 20+ keywords for comprehensive coverage"
    - "Financial readiness indicators (pricing pages, financing, memberships) boost scores"
    - "Competitive device saturation detection prevents wasted effort on oversaturated practices"
    - "Patient demographics (women's health, men's health, affluent) influence scoring"
    - "Website/social presence indicators quantify marketing readiness"
  
  fairness:
