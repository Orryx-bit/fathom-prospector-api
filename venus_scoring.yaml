# VENUS CONCEPTS - SALES BRAIN SCORING SYSTEM
# ========================================
# Philosophy: "Find BUYERS, Not Perfect Matches"
# 
# This scoring system reflects real-world sales strategy:
# 1. **Dinosaur Hunter Strategy**: Competitors = Upgrade Targets (NOT disqualifiers)
# 2. **Gateway Drug Strategy**: Find practices "dipping toes" without major equipment
# 3. **Staff-Dependent Logic**: Device recommendations based on WHO works there
# 4. **Saturation Threshold**: Too many devices = Hoarder Penalty
# 5. **GLP-1 Gap Priority**: Weight loss clinics with loose skin opportunity (HIGHEST SCORES)
#
# Scoring Range: 0-100 points per device
# Target Scores: GLP-1 Opportunities = 90-100 | Dinosaur Trade-ins = 85-95 | Gateway Targets = 70-85
