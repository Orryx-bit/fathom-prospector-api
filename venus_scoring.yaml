# VENUS CONCEPTS - MANUFACTURER SCORING SYSTEM v3.0
# ============================================================================
# Philosophy: "Best Device Match" Scoring
# - Each device scores independently (0-100 points)
# - Highest-scoring device = Manufacturer Opportunity Score
# - NO body vs. face bias
# - Show only WINNING device breakdown for actionable intelligence

# SCORING METHODOLOGY
# ============================================================================

scoring_approach:
  method: "Device-Specific Custom Scoring"
  max_points_per_device: 100
  manufacturer_score_calculation: "MAX(all device scores)"
  breakdown_display: "winning_device_only"
  fairness_principle: "All devices equal max points - no category bias"
  
implementation_notes:
  - "Backend scores each device independently"
  - "Viva (facial) can score 100, Bliss MAX (body) can score 100"
  - "Nova gets GLP-1 bonus, Viva gets dermatology bonus, etc."
  - "Only show winning device's specific breakdown to rep"
  - "Prevents body-device bias in scoring"
