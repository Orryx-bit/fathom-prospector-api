# VENUS CONCEPTS - MANUFACTURER SCORING SYSTEM v4.2 BEEFED UP
# ============================================================================
# Philosophy: "Best Device Match" + "Enhanced Business Type Intelligence" + "Device Intelligence from Research"
# - Each device scores independently (0-100 points)
# - Highest-scoring device = Manufacturer Opportunity Score
# - Business type detection with cash-pay infrastructure prioritization
# - ENHANCED PRAM Framework: Up to 60 points
# - NEW: Branded program keywords (TriBody, Trim & Tite, TriBella)
# - NEW: Technology acronym detection ((MP)², SmartScan, FlexMAX, VariPulse)
# - NEW: Colloquial body area terms (muffin top, saddle bags, bra fat)
# - NEW: GLP-1 muscle loss gap detection
# - NEW: Membership economy keywords (MRR, subscription aesthetics)
# - NEW: IoT/practice intelligence keywords
# - Expanded GLP-1 detection with 30+ weight-loss keywords
# - Show only WINNING device breakdown for actionable intelligence
