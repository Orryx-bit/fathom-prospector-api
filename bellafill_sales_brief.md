INSTRUCTIONS:
Generate a concise, actionable Sales Brief that includes:
1.  **The "Why Now" Hook**: A compelling reason to contact them immediately based on their data (e.g., they offer microneedling but no biostimulator, or they focus on acne scars).
2.  **Competitive Angle**: How to position Bellafill against likely competitors they might use (e.g., Sculptra, Radiesse, HA fillers) based on their practice type.
    *   *Note: Bellafill is the ONLY FDA-approved filler for acne scars and offers 5-year duration.*
3.  **Regenerative & Exosome Opportunity**: If they offer PRP/Microneedling, highlight the "Regenerative Aesthetics" synergy.
4.  **Sexual Wellness/Men's Health**: If applicable, mention Bellafill for girth enhancement (off-label but relevant if they do P-Shot/Men's Health).
5.  **3 Discovery Questions**: Specific, high-yield questions to ask the provider to uncover pain points.
